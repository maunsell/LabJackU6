These configuration files are shared amongst all of the MW projects.  There are several important consequences of this arrangement:

1) The version-controlled "master" versions of these files live in the mw_build repository and get installed by a script into the MWorks application support directory.  Editing them directly from this project will result in the changes not "sticking"

2) Any changes made to these configuration files must not mess up the other projects
